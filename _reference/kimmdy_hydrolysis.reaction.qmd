`reaction`



## Classes

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [HydrolysisReaction](#kimmdy_hydrolysis.reaction.HydrolysisReaction) | Hydrolyses peptide bonds of the backbone. |

### HydrolysisReaction { #kimmdy_hydrolysis.reaction.HydrolysisReaction }

```python
reaction.HydrolysisReaction()
```

Hydrolyses peptide bonds of the backbone.

#### Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_steps_for_id_c_at_t](#kimmdy_hydrolysis.reaction.HydrolysisReaction.get_steps_for_id_c_at_t) | Get the steps for a given bond at a given time. |
| [times_to_timespans](#kimmdy_hydrolysis.reaction.HydrolysisReaction.times_to_timespans) | Transforms an array of times into a list of time intervals |

##### get_steps_for_id_c_at_t { #kimmdy_hydrolysis.reaction.HydrolysisReaction.get_steps_for_id_c_at_t }

```python
reaction.HydrolysisReaction.get_steps_for_id_c_at_t(key, ttime)
```

Get the steps for a given bond at a given time.

The bond is identified by the atom id of the C atom.

##### times_to_timespans { #kimmdy_hydrolysis.reaction.HydrolysisReaction.times_to_timespans }

```python
reaction.HydrolysisReaction.times_to_timespans(times)
```

Transforms an array of times into a list of time intervals
times are an array of times at which the SASA was calculated
timespans are the time intervals between those times
as tuples of (start, end)
